- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @diegofarela
-  Iâ€™m data analyst with a programming background 
-  Iâ€™m currently finishing my studies at UC Davis while also doing independent studies

Welcome to my portfolio of projects!

I have a python game that shows some of my programming skills and a multi-program data analysis 
on data from a cycling company who is considering if converting their casual riders into members is worthwhile.

I go for quality over quantity, this are few projects but they have months of work behind them and it will soon 
become self evident.

Enjoy the trip!
